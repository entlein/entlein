- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @entlein
- ğŸ‘€ k8s, eBPF, cybersec, physics, music and all things devops

- Im an entrepreneurial researcher who wants to make our world more cyberresilient. Thus I maintain the kubernetes-stormcenter and create educational tools to lower entrance barriers for true understanding of threats.
- I also offer master thesis projects

I entirely self-fund my work and rely on soft-money, thus cannot guarantee any future commitments
